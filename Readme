### A Multi-Agent Automation Pipeline for Structured Content Generation

---

## 1. Overview

This project implements a modular, agent-based automation system that generates structured content from a small product dataset. It follows the requirements of the Kasparro Applied AI Engineer Challenge.

The system reads a single product dataset and automatically produces:

* A FAQ page
* A Product Description page
* A Comparison page

All outputs are generated as clean JSON files.

---

## 2. Features

* Multi-agent architecture
* Template-based content generation
* Reusable content logic blocks
* Automatic question generation
* Automatic FAQ answer generation
* Structured comparison with a fictional competitor product
* Full automation controlled by an orchestrator
* Machine-readable JSON output

---

## 3. Agents Used

The system includes the following agents:

* ParserAgent
* QuestionGeneratorAgent
* TemplateAgent
* ComparisonAgent
* PageAssemblyAgent

Each agent has a single responsibility and works only through structured inputs and outputs.

---

## 4. Logic Blocks

Reusable logic modules provide content transformation:

* Benefits Block
* Usage Block
* Safety Block
* Comparison Block
* FAQ Answer Block

These blocks make the system easy to extend and maintain.

---

## 5. Output Files

Running the system generates three JSON files inside the `output` folder:

* `faq.json`
* `product_page.json`
* `comparison_page.json`

These files contain fully structured, machine-readable content.

## 6. How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python 3.x
3. Navigate to the project root
4. Run the main script:

```
python3 main.py
```

After running the script, the output JSON files will be available in the `output` folder.

## 9. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the design of a production-style AI content generation system. It uses multiple agents, reusable logic, well-defined templates and a clear automation pipeline. The system is fully aligned with the engineering expectations of the Kasparro Applied AI Engineer Challenge.
